# A Raspberry Pi robot that helps people make their grocery list.
**Jean-Pierre** is a little DIY robot based on the **Raspberry Pi Zero W** that uses a **camera** to **scan food barcodes** : it fetches information about the product from the [**OpenFoodFacts API**](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) and adds it to a **grocery list** that the user can manage from a **web interface**.

On this repository, you'll find everything you need to build and configure your own **Jean-Pierre**.

## What does it look like ?
**Prototype :** For now, it just looks like a random **Raspberry Pi Zero** with a **camera module**, a **buzzer**, and a **glorious mustache**.

## How does it work ?
**Just place a product in front of Jean-Pierre's camera** : it will detect its barcode and try to find info about it before adding it to the grocery list.

## Web interface
**Jean-Pierre comes with a web interface** that allows users to manage their grocery list and products database from a computer or smartphone.
