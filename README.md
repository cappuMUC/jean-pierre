# A Raspberry Pi robot that helps people make their grocery list.
**Jean-Pierre** is a bot based on the **Raspberry Pi Zero W** that uses a **camera** to **scan food barcodes** : it fetches information about the product from the **OpenFoodFacts API** (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) and adds it to a **grocery list** that the user can manage from a **web interface**.

## What does it look like ?
For now, it just looks like a random Raspberry Pi Zero with a camera module, a buzzer and a glorious mustache.

## How does it work ?
Just place a product in front of Jean-Pierre's camera : it will detect the barcode and try to find infos about it before adding it to the grocery list.

## Web interface
Jean-Pierre's come with a web interface that allows users to manage their grocery list and products database from a computer or smartphone.
